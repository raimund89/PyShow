# PyShow
Make your presentations scriptable! This Python and PyQt5 based slide show IDE lets you write your slide shows using an easy-to-use scripting language. This scripting language allows you more control over your presentation flow, removes the borders between slides and enables automatic generation of your presentation using any language you want!

# Current development status
I'm slowly developing this software in my free time. No guarantees that a new commit won't break the software :) Stick to the releases if you want any kind of stability, although I also cannot guarantee that :P

# Features for future implementation
- Include directive, to for example include a template file
- Support for URLs for images, gifs, videos, audio, includes, etc.
- Compilation of presentation into a standalone file (exe/py?)
- Support for plot generation from data
- Functions, for repetative actions
- Re-usable resources (images, videos, etc.) so loading is only done once
- Notes for presenter when using double screen
- Quick navigation (for example for Q&A session)
