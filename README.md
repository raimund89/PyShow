# PyShow
Make your presentations scriptable! This Python and PyQt5 based slide show IDE lets you write your slide shows using an easy-to-use scripting language. This scripting language allows you more control over your presentation flow, removes the borders between slides and enables automatic generation of your presentation using any language you want!

# Current development status
I'm slowly developing this software in my free time. No guarantees that a new commit won't break the software :) Stick to the releases if you want any kind of stability, although I also cannot guarantee that :P
